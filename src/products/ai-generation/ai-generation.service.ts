    const selectedMatch = selectedMatchContext?.visual_matches?.[0]; // Use only the single selected match

    if (selectedMatch) {
        // Extract key info for clarity in the prompt
        const matchTitle = selectedMatch.title;
        const matchPrice = selectedMatch.price?.extracted_value ?? 'N/A';
        const matchSource = selectedMatch.source;
        const matchLink = selectedMatch.link;

### **User-Provided Context (CRITICAL)**

The user has identified a similar product online. This context is your primary source for strategic enrichment. Deeply analyze this information.

*   **Match Data:** ${relevantMatchContext}
*   **Thumbnail:** ${matchThumb}

### **Strategic Guidance & Analysis Protocol (Context-Based)**

1.  **Image Analysis:** Scrutinize the product in \${coverImageUrl}. Identify its type, color, material, specific features, brand names, model numbers, and overall condition. Extract every possible visual detail.
2.  **Contextual Deconstruction:** Synthesize your image analysis with the provided match context.
    *   **Competitive Pricing:** Use the match price (\`\${matchPrice}\` USD) as a baseline. Propose a competitive \`price\` in USD. You MUST also suggest a \`compareAtPrice\` that is realistically 15-25% higher to create a sense of value.
    *   **Keyword-Rich Titling:** The match title ("\${matchTitle}") is a keyword goldmine. Do not copy it. Create a new, unique title that incorporates the most powerful keywords from the match title, combined with details from your image analysis.
    *   **Benefit-Oriented Description:** Write a compelling \`description\` that tells a story. Explain the benefits to the customer. Synthesize information from the image and the match context.
    *   **Hyper-Specific Categorization:** Use the image and context to determine the most granular \`categorySuggestion\` possible for each platform.`;

    } else {
        promptText += `\n\n---

### **Strategic Guidance & Analysis Protocol (Image-Only)**

You have NOT been provided with a specific online match. Your analysis must be based **exclusively** on the provided image and your deep, general knowledge of e-commerce, products, and marketing. You must be resourceful and infer details as an expert would.

1.  **Forensic Image Analysis:** Scrutinize the product in \`\${coverImageUrl}\`. This is your only source of truth. Identify:
    *   **Primary Subject:** What is the product? Be specific.
    *   **Branding/Logos:** Are there any brand names, logos, or identifying marks?
    *   **Materials & Texture:** What is it made of? (e.g., "cotton", "brushed aluminum", "glazed ceramic").
    *   **Colors & Patterns:** List all visible colors and describe any patterns.
    *   **Features & Details:** Note any unique features (e.g., "zipper closure", "embossed logo", "hand-painted details").
    *   **Condition & Quality:** Assess the condition ("New", "Used", "Handmade") and infer its quality from the visual evidence.
    *   **Quantity:** Is it a single item or a pack?

2.  **Expert Inference & Content Generation:**
    *   **Market-Based Pricing:** Based on your analysis, infer the product's likely market segment. Suggest a realistic and competitive market \`price\` in USD. You MUST also suggest a \`compareAtPrice\` that is realistically 15-25% higher to create a sense of value.
    *   **Keyword-Rich Titling:** Generate a descriptive, unique, and SEO-friendly \`title\`. Combine identified brand, material, color, and features into a title a user would search for.
    *   **Benefit-Oriented Description:** Write a compelling \`description\` that tells a story. Based on the inferred features, explain the *benefits* to the customer. Why should they buy it? How will it enhance their life? What problem does it solve?
    *   **Hyper-Specific Categorization:** From the image alone, determine the most granular and commercially-relevant \`categorySuggestion\` for each platform.`;
    }

    promptText += `\n\n---

### **Variant Logic (CRITICAL - NO DEVIATION)**
The product-level \`title\` must be the complete, descriptive product name. The variant-level ${matchTitle} should describe the specific variation.
*   **Single, indivisible items (e.g., a trading card):** Product-level title: "Pokemon Charizard VMAX Holographic Card". Variant-level ${title}: "Single Card".
*   **Packs/Bundles (e.g., lipsticks):** Product-level title: "Maybelline SuperStay Matte Ink Liquid Lipstick". Variant-level ${title}: "Pack of 3".
*   **Products with multiple attributes (e.g., equipment):** Product-level title: "Sterling Pro-Series Bowling Ball". Variant-level ${title} must describe the specific variation, e.g., "Cosmic Green - 10lb" or "Ruby Red - 5lb".
*   **Default Titles:** NEVER use generic variant titles like "Default Title" or "Standard". Find a canonical grouping (weight, size, color, quantity).

### **Platform-Specific Field Requirements**

Generate details tailored for **EACH** platform specified in ${targetPlatforms.join(', ')}. Omit any field that is not applicable or cannot be determined.

*   **Common Fields (All Platforms):**
    *   \`title\`: SEO-optimized and compelling.
    *   \`description\`: Detailed, benefit-focused, and well-structured, modeled after the Amazon example.
    *   \`price\`: Competitive price in USD (required).
    *   \`compareAtPrice\`: Optional higher price for showing a sale (must be higher than price).
    *   \`weight\`: Estimated weight.
    *   \`weightUnit\`: 'lb', 'kg', 'oz', 'g'.
    *   \`brand\`: Product brand, if identifiable.
